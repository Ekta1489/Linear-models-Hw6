\#Reading the data set and tidying the data. Converted the numeric to
factor variables. Removed pnumlbw, pnumsga, malform as these variables
had a value of 0 for all the observations.So, there was no point keeping
these variables in the dataset.

``` r
baby_data = read_csv(file = "./data/birthweight.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
  ) %>%
  select(-pnumlbw, -pnumsga, -malform)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

\#Checking if there are any missing variables. After running the code,
we see that there are no missing variables; Therefore, we do not have to
do anything more to clean the data.

``` r
filter_all(
  baby_data, any_vars(is.na(.))
)
```

    ## # A tibble: 0 x 17
    ## # â€¦ with 17 variables: babysex <fct>, bhead <dbl>, blength <dbl>,
    ## #   bwt <dbl>, delwt <dbl>, fincome <dbl>, frace <fct>, gaweeks <dbl>,
    ## #   menarche <dbl>, mheight <dbl>, momage <dbl>, mrace <fct>,
    ## #   parity <dbl>, ppbmi <dbl>, ppwt <dbl>, smoken <dbl>, wtgain <dbl>

\#Propose a regression model for birthweight. As the outcome is
continuous, we can fit a linear regression model.
